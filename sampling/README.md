These example scripts are intended to supplement the content of Optimus for those users who find that their data may be too large to be processed. The intention is that sampling is performed outside of Optimus, it is run on the sample and then a knn is used to apply the labels generated by Optimus to those points which are not sampled.

This directory includes a simple random sample approach in `simplesample.py`. This program will not run from here without error, if you want to use it please copy the file to the root directory of Optimus and run from there. It both assume your data is in `data/words.csv`. If you wish to perform a more complex sample approach it is recommended to try [apricot](https://github.com/jmschrei/apricot), however the mechanism for tracking which words are sampled becomes more complex.
